OpenLogViewer is an open source project created out of bordom.
with that being said I have no intention on making the program unusable or even hard to use. 
I would eventually love for the program to become mainstream in the Automotive Datalog area as a tool.


on 3/16/2011 the project was moved to Maven, it can however still be built by Ant


step 1: cd to base directory of OpenLogViewer

step 2:  ant
this will build and package the source into a executable jar file in the folder
/path/to/OpenLogViewer/target/OpenLogViewer-0.0.1.jar

step 3: cd target

step 4:java -jar OpenLogViewer-0.0.1.jar

and thats about all there is to it!
